# Good Architecture

The hallmarks of a good architecture include:

1. **Modularity**: The system is divided into smaller, manageable modules or components, each with a specific responsibility.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Different concerns or aspects of the application are separated, making it easier to manage and evolve the system: breaking your architecture into distinct tiers.
3. **Loose Coupling**: Weak knowledge associations between components, designed to be independent, minimizing dependencies and allowing for easier changes and replacements.
4. **Law of Demeter**: Components should only communicate with their immediate neighbors, reducing the risk of cascading changes and making the system more robust.
