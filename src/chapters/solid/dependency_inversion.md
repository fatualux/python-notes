# Dependency Inversion Principle

”The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) tells us that the most flexible 
systems are those in which source code dependencies refer only to 
abstractions, not to concretions.” 
(Robert C. Martin, Clean Architecture)

”a. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both 
should depend on abstractions.
b. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on 
abstractions.” 
(Robert C. Martin, Agile Software Development)

CONCLUSION

Prefer to depend on abstractions (i.e. abstract classes or 
concepts) instead of concrete types.
