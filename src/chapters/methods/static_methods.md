# Static Methods

Static methods are methods that do not operate on an instance or the class itself. They do not require access to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) and are used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not need to modify class or instance state. Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.

### Defining Static Methods

Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take `self` or `cls` as their first parameter.

#### Example:

```python
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# Call static methods directly on the class
print(MathUtils.add(5, 3))      # Output: 8
print(MathUtils.multiply(4, 6)) # Output: 24
```

### Characteristics

- **No Access to Instance or Class**: Static methods do not have access to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`). They operate independently of class or instance data.
- **Utility Functions**: Typically used for utility functions that perform a task related to the class but do not need to access or modify class or instance state.
- **Namespace Organization**: They help organize related functions within a class namespace without needing to instantiate the class.

### When to Use Static Methods

- **Utility Functions**: Use static methods for functions that perform operations not dependent on instance or class state but are logically related to the class.
- **Code Organization**: Static methods help group functions that are related to a class together, improving code organization and readability.

### Example: Static Method for Validation

```python
class UserValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_email(email):
        return "@" in email and "." in email

# Validate an email address using the static method
print(UserValidator.is_valid_email("user@example.com"))  # Output: True
print(UserValidator.is_valid_email("userexample.com"))    # Output: False
```

### Key Differences from Class and Instance Methods

- **No `self` or `cls`**: Unlike instance methods and class methods, static methods do not have access to `self` or `cls`. They do not operate on instance or class data.
- **Purpose**: Static methods are best suited for operations that are related to the class but do not require interaction with instance or class-specific data.

### Best Practices

- **Use for Helper Functions**: Use static methods for helper functions that logically belong to a class but do not need to interact with class or instance attributes.
- **Avoid Side Effects**: Ensure static methods do not modify global or external state, as they should remain self-contained.
- **Maintain Readability**: Use static methods to improve code readability and organization by keeping related functionality within the class namespace.
