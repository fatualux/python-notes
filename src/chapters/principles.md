Python is a high-level, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.

You can use it as a procedural language in scripting, or as an object-oriented, imperative or functional programming language.

Other peculiarities of this language are ***portability*** and ***coherence***, where coherence is meant as the ironclad logic that distinguishes it
, which often allows to deduce the meaning of unknown objects, simply, from their names.
