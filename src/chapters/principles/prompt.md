I will provide a markdown page to you as an example., then a concept to explain.

- Provide only raw markdown code
- if you want to insert code snippets, use @@@ instead of ```
- Be synthetic but exhaustive
- Be concise
- Be readable
- Avoid redundances
- Be informative
- Be accessible
- Be understandable

# Basic rules to write good code

### D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself)

![D.R.Y.](../../static/images/dry.png)

Duplicating some parts of code is an extremely bad practice.

It causes the code to become hardly readable, redundant and difficult to maintain.

### PEP8

![PEP8](../../static/images/pep8.png)

PEP8 is a style guide for Python code.

This acronym, PEP, stands for ***Python Enhancement Proposal***, and it is the primary way to propose new features in Python and share issues and suggestions with the community.

The most famous, [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), lays down a simple set of guidelines to keep the code readable and maintainable.

Some PEP8's rules are:

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Use 79 characters per line.
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.
- Extra blank lines may be used to separate groups of related functions.
- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
- Imports should usually be on separate lines:
- Imports are always put at the top of the file.
