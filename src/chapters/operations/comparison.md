# Comparison Operations

Comparison operations are used to compare two values and determine their relationship. They return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the result of the comparison.

### Common Comparison Operators

1. **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.

   ```python
   a = 5
   b = 5
   result = (a == b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.

   ```python
   a = 5
   b = 3
   result = (a != b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

3. **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.

   ```python
   a = 7
   b = 5
   result = (a > b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

4. **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.

   ```python
   a = 3
   b = 5
   result = (a < b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.

   ```python
   a = 5
   b = 5
   result = (a >= b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

   ```python
   a = 4
   b = 5
   result = (a <= b)  # True
   print(result)  # Output: True
   ```

### Conclusion

Comparison operations are essential for decision-making in programming. They enable you to compare values and control the flow of your code based on conditions, facilitating logical reasoning and branching.
