# Assignment Operations

### Basic Assignment

- **Simple Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns a value to a variable.

   ```python
   x = 10
   ```

### Compound Assignment Operators

1. **Addition (`+=`)**: Adds and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 5
   x += 3  # x = x + 3
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-=`)**: Subtracts and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 10
   x -= 4  # x = x - 4
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*=`)**: Multiplies and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 7
   x *= 2  # x = x * 2
   ```

4. **Division (`/=`)**: Divides and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 20
   x /= 4  # x = x / 4
   ```

5. **Floor Division (`//=`)**: Floor divides and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 17
   x //= 3  # x = x // 3
   ```

6. **Modulus (`%=`)**: Applies modulus and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 14
   x %= 5  # x = x % 5
   ```

7. **Exponentiation (`**=`)**: Exponentiates and assigns.

   ```python
   x = 2
   x **= 3  # x = x ** 3
   ```

8. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - **AND (`&=`)**: Applies bitwise AND.
   - **OR (`|=`)**: Applies bitwise OR.
   - **XOR (`^=`)**: Applies bitwise XOR.
   - **Left Shift (`<<=`)**: Shifts bits left.
   - **Right Shift (`>>=`)**: Shifts bits right.

   ```python
   x = 8
   x &= 3  # x = x & 3
   ```

### Conclusion

Assignment operations simplify updating variables through arithmetic, bitwise, and compound operations, improving code conciseness and readability.
