# Gang of Four (GoF) Patterns

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** patterns are a set of **23 design patterns** that were introduced in the book **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** by **Erich Gamma**, **Richard Helm**, **Ralph Johnson**, and **John Vlissides**.

These patterns are categorized into three main types: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns.

They provide solutions to common design problems and help improve **code maintainability**, **flexibility**, and **reusability**.

They are widely used in **software development** and have become a standard reference for **design patterns** in **object-oriented programming**.
