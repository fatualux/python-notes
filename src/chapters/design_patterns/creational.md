# Creational Patterns

**Creational design patterns** are concerned with the way of creating objects.

They provide various **object creation mechanisms**, which increase **flexibility** and **reuse** of existing code.

They are particularly useful in situations where the system needs to be **independent** of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

The most common **Creational design patterns** are:
1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
5. **Prototype**: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a
    prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.
    
These patterns help in managing the complexity of object creation, promoting code reuse, and enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.
