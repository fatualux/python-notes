# Threads

Threads are a lightweight way to achieve concurrency within a single process in Python. They allow multiple operations to run concurrently, making them useful for tasks that involve waiting, such as I/O operations, without blocking the entire program. Threads share the same memory space, which allows them to easily communicate but also introduces challenges such as race conditions.

### Basics of Threading

- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share the same memory space and can run concurrently.

- **Creating a Thread**:
  - The `threading` module provides the `Thread` class, which can be used to create and manage threads.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import threading

    def print_numbers():
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)

    thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()  # Waits for the thread to complete
    ```

### Thread Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: A thread is created but not yet running.
2. **Start**: The thread starts running after calling `start()`.
3. **Running**: The thread's target function is being executed.
4. **Blocked**: The thread is waiting for a resource or another thread.
5. **Termination**: The thread completes its execution or is terminated by an exception.

### Key Methods

- **`start()`**: Starts the thread's activity.
- **`join()`**: Waits for the thread to finish.
- **`is_alive()`**: Checks if the thread is still running.
- **`daemon`**: A daemon thread runs in the background and does not prevent the program from exiting.

### Daemon vs. Non-Daemon Threads

- **Daemon Threads**: Run in the background and automatically terminate when the main program exits. They are useful for background tasks that should not block program termination.
  - Example:
    ```python
    thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers, daemon=True)
    thread.start()
    # Program can exit even if thread is still running
    ```

- **Non-Daemon Threads**: Prevent the program from exiting until they have completed execution.

### Synchronization and Thread Safety

When multiple threads access shared data or resources, there is a risk of race conditions, where the outcome depends on the timing of threads. Python provides mechanisms like locks to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time.

- **Locks**:
  - A lock is a synchronization primitive that prevents multiple threads from executing certain sections of code simultaneously.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import threading

    lock = threading.Lock()
    counter = 0

    def increment_counter():
        global counter
        with lock:  # Ensure exclusive access to the counter
            counter += 1

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment_counter) for _ in range(10)]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    ```

### Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

- The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This means that even in a multi-threaded Python program, only one thread executes Python code at a time.
- **Implication**: The GIL can limit the performance benefits of threading for CPU-bound tasks, as threads cannot fully utilize multiple CPU cores simultaneously.

### Use Cases for Threads

- **I/O-Bound Tasks**: Threads are particularly useful for tasks that involve waiting for I/O operations, such as reading from a file, fetching data from a network, or interacting with a database.
- **Background Tasks**: Running tasks that should not interfere with the main program flow, like updating a UI, monitoring resources, or handling background logging.

### Example: Multi-threaded Web Scraping

- Threads can be used to speed up tasks like web scraping by fetching multiple URLs concurrently.
- Example:
  ```python
  import threading
  import requests

  def fetch_url(url):
      response = requests.get(url)
      print(f"Fetched {url} with status {response.status_code}")

  urls = ["https://example.com", "https://python.org", "https://github.com"]
  threads = [threading.Thread(target=fetch_url, args=(url,)) for url in urls]

  for thread in threads:
      thread.start()
  for thread in threads:
      thread.join()  # Wait for all threads to complete
  ```

### Conclusion

Threads provide a simple and effective way to achieve concurrency in Python, particularly for I/O-bound tasks. While they are easy to use, developers must be cautious about thread safety and the limitations imposed by the GIL. Understanding how to properly use threads, including synchronization mechanisms like locks, is essential for writing robust concurrent programs.
