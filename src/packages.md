# Packages

Every Python file, which has extension `.py`, is called *module*.

Python let us group these files into structures called **packages**, which are basically folders, containing an ```__init__.py``` file.
This file may contain no code, but its presence is mandatory (till Python version 3.3) to let the interpreter treat it as a package rather then a common folder.
