# Namespaces

A namespace is a system that ensures the unique identification of the names in a program. It's like a container that holds a set of identifiers (names) and their associated objects.

There are different types of namespaces in Python:

- **Local** Namespace: the scope of a function, containing names defined within that function.
- **Global** Namespace: the scope of a module, containing names defined at the top level of the module.
- **Built-in** Namespace: Contains names that are predefined in Python, such as functions like len and range.
